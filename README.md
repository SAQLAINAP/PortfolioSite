Video Demo: https://youtu.be/SlaqvI4TcpE
Description:
hi guys this is my first portfolio website with a fully responsive home page which I created using HTML CSS and some JavaScript. This page offers an introduction about myself and has links leading to the other web pages which I have created. The other web pages which I have created include useful websites,tricks and tips and others. I have also included a feedback box at the bottom of the page to receive feedback from the users. Thank you CS50
